						Technical indicators are used by traders to gain insight into the supply and demand of
						securities and market psychology. Together, these indicators form the basis of technical
						analysis. Metrics, such as trading&nbsp;volume,
						provide&nbsp;clues as to whether a&nbsp;price move will continue. In this way, indicators
						can be used to generate buy and sell signals.

						Use the&nbsp;on-balance volume to measure the positive and negative flow
						of&nbsp;volume&nbsp;in a
						security over time. The indicator is a running total of up volume minus down volume. Up volume
						is how
						much volume there is on a day when the price rallies. Down volume is
						the volume on a day when the price falls. Each day volume is added or subtracted from the
						indicator based on whether the price went higher or lower.

						When OBV rises, it&nbsp;shows that buyers will step in and push&nbsp;the price higher. When
						OBV falls, the selling volume outpaces the buying volume, which indicates lower
						prices.<span class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-1"

						confirmation tool. If price and OBV are rising, that helps indicate a continuation of the

					<p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						Traders who use OBV also watch for&nbsp;divergence. This

						rising&nbsp;but OBV is falling, that could indicate that the trend is not backed by strong
						buyers and could soon reverse.

						Similar to OBV, this indicator also accounts for the&nbsp;&nbsp;for the period and where the close is in relation to that range in
						addition to the&nbsp;closing&nbsp;price of the security for the period.<span
							class="mntl-inline-citation mntl-dynamic-tooltip--trigger" data-id="#citation-2"
							tabindex="0">2</span> If a stock finishes near its high, the indicator gives volume more
						weight than if it closes near the midpoint of its range. The different calculations mean
						that OBV will work better in some cases and A/D will work better in others.

					<div id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"></div>
					<p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						If the indicator line trends&nbsp;up, it shows buying interest, since the stock closes above
						the halfway point of the range. This helps confirm an uptrend. On the
						other hand, if A/D falls, that means the price is finishing in the lower portion of its
						daily range, and thus volume is considered negative. This helps confirm a downtrend.&nbsp;

					<p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						Traders using the A/D line also watch for divergence. If the A/D starts falling
						while&nbsp;the price rises, this signals that the trend is in
						trouble and could reverse. Similarly,&nbsp;if the price trends lower and A/D starts rising,
						that could signal higher prices to come.

					<p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						When the Aroon Up crosses above the Aroon Down, that is the first sign of a possible trend

						Down stays near zero, that is positive confirmation of an uptrend.

						A third use for the RSI is support and resistance levels. During uptrends, a stock will
						often&nbsp;hold above the 30&nbsp;level and frequently reach 70 or above. When a stock is in
						a downtrend, the RSI will typically hold below 70 and frequently reach 30 or below.

						The&nbsp;stochastic oscillator&nbsp;measures the current price relative to
						the price range over a number of periods. Plotted between zero and 100, the idea is that the
						price should make new highs when the trend is up. In a downtrend, the price tends to make
						new lows. The stochastic tracks whether this is happening.<span

					<p id="mntl-sc-block_81-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						The stochastic moves up and down relatively quickly as it is&nbsp;rare for the price to make
						continual highs, keeping the stochastic near 100,&nbsp;or continual lows, keeping the
						stochastic near zero. Therefore, the stochastic is often used as an overbought and oversold
						indicator. Values above 80 are considered overbought, while levels below 20 are considered
						oversold.

					<p id="mntl-sc-block_83-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block finance-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">
						Consider the overall price&nbsp;trend&nbsp;when using overbought and oversold levels. For example, during
						an&nbsp;uptrend, when the indicator drops below 20 and rises back above it, that is a
						possible&nbsp;buy signal. But rallies above 80
						are less consequential because we expect to see the indicator move to 80 and above regularly
						during an uptrend. During a downtrend, look for the indicator to move above 80 and then drop
						back below to signal a possible short trade. The 20 level&nbsp;is less significant in a
						downtrend.
